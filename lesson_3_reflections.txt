When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When collaborating with others or wanting to share and distribute my work. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I might not want what's in the remote repository on my local repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork lets me make a copy of someone else's repository directly on the GitHub servers without pulling down the code to my local machine first. A forked repository is linked back to the original creator and also makes it easier to suggest changes back to the original repository. A branch is created when I want to split away from Master to test concepts and ideas and only happens within a single repository. A clone is duplicating a repository on my local version or duplicating a repository from GitHub down to local.  

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
